I find a well-commented git source code(based on Linus Torvalds first commit version) on the Internet, which is named baby-git by the modifier. It should be a nice footboard for those people who want to contribute to the actual git project(including me ԅ(≖‿≖ԅ)).

The =baby-git= project URL: https://bitbucket.org/jacobstopak/baby-git/src/master/. However, in my last visit to the website, the page is blank, but you can still clone the repository via the following command:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/jacobstopak/baby-git.git
#+end_src
